Software engineer, aspiring polymath. I like to do a little bit of everything.

Interested in proving correctness, embedded systems, system design, genetic engineering, microscopy, 
mechanical engineering, pure math (mostly algebra, category theory, number theory), operating systems design,
security, and more.

Open to research work and projects ([email me](mailto:hello@clortox.com))
